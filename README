Set of assorted scripts for working with a combined log file, in my case generated by apache logging with syslog to a central syslog-ng server:

<pre>
#Apache Config
CustomLog "|/root/scripts/logger.pl" vcombined
</pre>

<pre>
#logger script
#!/usr/bin/perl -w

use strict;

use Sys::Syslog qw( :DEFAULT setlogsock );

setlogsock('unix');
openlog('apache', '', 'local4');

while (my $log = <STDIN>) {
    syslog('notice', $log);
}
closelog;
</pre>

clienttop.py  - live updating list of which IPs requests are coming from
vhosttop.py  - live updating list of which vhosts are serving traffic and response code breakdown
whichservers.rb - live updating table of which vhosts are landing on which web servers in a cluster
